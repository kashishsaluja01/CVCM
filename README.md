# CVCM(Covid Vaccine Centre Management)
This is a 2-tier Java Core project that is using J2SE as frontend and MS-SQL Database as backend. This project aims at mantaining records. Here the forms are in such a way that user can register himself for the dosage of any medicines available and after dosage can generate his certificate. All the forms have direct connection with the database.
I've used Netbeans and MS-SQL for implementing this project.
